I've been programming since ~2015  
I am currently working as a C# Backend Dev also dabbling a bit in our frontend (React | TS) at work  

Please don't bash my code....   
i'm working on improving and relearning from the ground up, so there may be some.. less than ideal code
  
make it work first - performance can come later
